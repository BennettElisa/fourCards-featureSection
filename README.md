# Frontend Mentor Challenge

## Hello, Hola! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my "Four cards feature section" web design. I used a FrontEnd Mentor challenge to create this four card freature section. I would recommend this challenge if you already feel comfortable with HTML and CSS skills, but not as a starting challenge if your a newbie. Some essential skills for this challenge include knowledge of CSS Flexbox, div elements, padding, margins and box shadows. I think this is a great challenge to test your CSS Flexbox skills as well as enhance your CSS styling. It's also a great way to drill down on thinking about div containers and how to use them to your advantage when spliting up the content.

**Personal Experience Suggestions:**
I would encourage you create a wireframe of the design related to how your div containers will divide up all the content. Another suggestion is to think about the cards horizontially and vertically.

**Favorite Part:**
My favorite parts about this challenge was each time I refreshed my web browser to see new feature added as I built it out.

**Growth Areas:**
In revisiting this challenge I would like enhance my design by making it mobile freely and complete the mobile friendly design also included in this challange.

Here are all the links that were included with this challenge if you'd like to give it a go!!
